# Online learning caller

`learning/` owns Python-side policy inference, optimizer state, seed
scheduling, curriculum, and evaluation accounting. It consumes the installed
`sts-learning-bridge` wheel; simulator mechanics, typed legality, checkpoint
contents, and NumPy semantic-schema production remain in Rust.

The first maintained component is `sts_learning.recovery`. It records only the
current episode generation for each environment slot. It keeps no trajectory
or checkpoint history and never decides automatically that a defeat should be
retried. A training caller explicitly performs:

```text
record terminal defeat
  -> prepare a budget-checked recovery ticket
  -> restore one opaque checkpoint batch through the bridge
  -> commit the ticket
```

If bridge restoration fails, the ledger remains at the pending defeat. The
held-out constructor fixes the recovery budget at zero, so evaluation cannot
silently become a training-style resurrection run.
Starting new episodes uses the same two-phase rule around the bridge's atomic
`reset_slots`: a failed reset leaves every completed ledger generation intact.

`sts_learning.seeds` assigns a seed to training or held-out evaluation with a
stable seed-only hash before any recovery attempt or derived trajectory exists.
Its schedule is immutable: planning a vector reset returns a separate advanced
schedule, and `reset_scheduled_with_accounting` returns that schedule only after
the environment reset and ledger commit succeed. Failed resets therefore
consume neither an episode generation nor a seed. A held-out ledger accepts
only held-out seeds and retains its structural zero-recovery budget.

The bridge verification command installs a fresh wheel and runs both bridge
smoke tests and these caller contracts:

```powershell
.\bindings\python_learning\verify.ps1 -Python <python-3.12-executable>
```
