# Combat Evidence And Offline Laboratories

This runbook covers read-only or isolated exact-combat investigations. None of
these commands changes production policy by itself. Treat a budget-limited
missing witness as unknown and exact-replay every claimed win.

The current schema name and version for each report are owned by its Rust
producer. Keep output paths descriptive and version-independent so a schema
revision cannot silently stale this recipe.

## Batch Combat Evidence Audit

Index local combat artifacts and replay exact case/action relationships:

```powershell
.\ol.cmd combat-evidence-audit
```

The root defaults to `.oracle-lab`; omitting `--output` creates a fresh ignored
report directory. Source artifacts are never rewritten.

The scanner consumes producer-owned `*combat-evidence-manifest.json` files
first. V2 manifests bind the case's typed replay capability, exact combat root,
optional run-session fingerprint, and optional owner-policy fingerprint. Every
artifact path is relative to the manifest itself and has exactly one resolution
base. On Windows, the manifest and its declared artifacts must therefore live
on the same volume. The scanner then revalidates root identity, action identity
and count, complete consumption, terminal outcome, and final player HP against
the simulator. A manifest is evidence routing, not an override of replay truth.

Legacy V1 manifests and declared trace relationships remain readable through
an explicitly labeled compatibility path. Undeclared action files are not
paired by matching stems or by counting cases in a directory; they remain
explicit unknowns until a producer-owned relationship exists.

The report directory contains:

- `summary.json`: aggregate counts, runtime identity, and source fingerprint;
- `evidence.jsonl`: normalized typed action transitions;
- `fiend-fire-windows.json`: the maintained Fiend Fire diagnostic projection;
- `unresolved.json`: evidence that could not be attributed or replayed.

Every exact card transition records a typed preceding-card bypass when it can
be constructed from exact card and target identity. Missing identity,
illegality, transition limits, and trace-only evidence remain separate
statuses.

### Typed Query Batches

Supply one `CombatEvidenceQueryBatchV1` document from a path or stdin:

```powershell
.\ol.cmd combat-evidence-audit --query-batch <query.json>
Get-Content -Raw -LiteralPath <query.json> | .\ol.cmd combat-evidence-audit --query-batch -
```

Queries filter typed record outcome, current and previous same-turn card
identity/type, target before/after state, HP and Block deltas, and the exact
bypass result. Each query is bounded by its declared match limit. The command
stores the normalized query batch and bounded typed results beside the report.
It does not contain card-specific policy conclusions, search, or ranking.

## Potion Expenditure Audit

Compare no-potion, each initial potion, and optionally small combinations from
one unchanged exact combat root:

```powershell
.\ol.cmd combat-case-potion-expenditure-audit `
  --case <case.json> `
  --max-combination-size 2 `
  --export-witness-actions-dir <fresh-output-directory> `
  --wall-ms-per-lane 10000
```

Every lane receives the same independent allowance. Explicit potion use is
filtered by exact slot without deleting potions from the root; actual
expenditure is replay-attributed by potion UUID. Passive Fairy Potion use is
therefore visible. A passive expenditure outside the lane's allowed slots
marks the witness non-compliant.

Explicit discard is excluded by default because it usually adds a mechanically
irrelevant duplicate search surface. Enable `--include-discard-actions` only
for a concrete slot-generation or revive-priority question.

The report includes final HP, final turn, action count, exact potion identity,
an optional experimental survival reserve, and a Pareto frontier. Missing
budget-limited witnesses do not establish potion value. Forced-rest avoidance,
future elite plans, slot overflow, future shops, and encounter-specific
preservation remain run-level questions unless exact continuation evidence is
present.

When witness export is enabled, each replay-verified lane writes an exact
`<lane-id>.actions.json` plus a producer manifest after lane validation. Feed
those actions directly to replay or trace commands instead of reconstructing
a promising line from display text.

For one-factor production-parity diagnosis:

- `--max-hp-loss <N>` uses production-shaped HP satisfaction;
- `--restore-witness-actions <actions.json>` preloads one exact incumbent in
  every compatible lane;
- `--authorized-root-potion-trial` is a laboratory ablation, never permission
  to spend a potion in production.

Production staging, quality satisfaction, survival floors, and potion
admission are maintained in
[../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md#runner-and-combat). Audit crossings are
evidence about that owner contract, not standalone spend labels.

## Fresh Owner-Generated Potion Case

Use a fresh capsule and two bounded phases when the investigation needs a
current owner-generated combat case with continuation context. The first phase
acquires ordinary run resources; the second deliberately lowers combat search
allowance so the next unresolved fight becomes a diagnostic case.

```powershell
$capsule = ".oracle-lab/collections/potion/<fresh-id>"
if (Test-Path -LiteralPath $capsule) {
  throw "choose a fresh capsule path: $capsule"
}

cargo run --quiet -p sts_oracle_tools --bin branch_tiny -- `
  --seed <seed> --ascension 0 --objective first-terminal `
  --generations 14 --max-branches 1 --auto-ops 512 `
  --search-nodes 100 --search-ms 50 `
  --rescue-search-nodes 300 --rescue-search-ms 100 `
  --boss-search-nodes 300 --boss-search-ms 100 `
  --wall-ms 10000 --run-capsule $capsule

if (Test-Path -LiteralPath "$capsule/frontier.json") {
  cargo run --quiet -p sts_oracle_tools --bin branch_tiny -- `
    --continue-capsule $capsule --continue-slices 1 `
    --generations 10 --max-branches 1 `
    --search-nodes 1 --search-ms 1 `
    --rescue-search-nodes 1 --rescue-search-ms 1 `
    --boss-search-nodes 1 --boss-search-ms 1 `
    --wall-ms 10000
}
```

The one-node phase is a capture mechanism, not evidence that the fight is
hard or unwinnable. Before interpreting a fresh case, require its saved search
summaries to agree on the exact root and captured continuation facts. When no
search summary carries those facts, the audit may reconstruct them from an
exact production-owner checkpoint only after the owner, run-session, and
combat-root identities validate; the report marks that source as
`reconstructed_production_context`. Cases without such a validated checkpoint
remain unavailable. Never infer route, Boss, post-victory, owner HP, or supply
facts from filenames or aggregate counts.

Run the audit with version-independent report names:

```powershell
$case = Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath "$capsule/combat_cases" `
  -Filter *.json -File | Select-Object -First 1

cargo oracle-lab combat-case-potion-expenditure-audit `
  --case $case.FullName `
  --max-combination-size 1 --survival-reserve-hp 30 `
  --max-nodes 5000 --max-selections 20000 `
  --wall-ms-per-lane 500 `
  > .oracle-lab/reports/<fresh-id>-potion-audit.json `
  2> .oracle-lab/reports/<fresh-id>-potion-audit.log
```

Keep complete output under `.oracle-lab` and report only aggregate lane
results. Route order is admitted only from typed ordering facts with retained
modality and provenance. Do not turn an experimental reserve crossing into a
spend verdict.

## Policy Discrepancy Complete Wins

Export a complete policy-discrepancy win with:

```powershell
.\ol.cmd combat-case-policy-discrepancy `
  --case <case.json> `
  --export-witness-actions <fresh-output>.actions.json
```

When search finds a complete exact-replayed win, the command writes the action
array and a sibling producer manifest. The manifest names the caller-supplied
case as its root, freezes the exact root and action identities, and records the
replayed terminal outcome and final player HP. The command report returns both
paths. If no witness is found, neither export is claimed.

This contract applies only to the complete winning witness. A descendant
`*.prefix.actions.json` still describes actions from an earlier original case
to the adjacent descendant case; it is not a witness starting at that
descendant and receives no manifest from this producer.

## Local-Graph Complete Wins

`combat-case-local-graph --export-witness-actions <fresh-output>.actions.json`
uses the same complete-witness export gate. Before writing, it replays the
actions from the search root, confirms a win, and requires the replay endpoint
to match the search witness. An ordinary case-root search writes a sibling
producer manifest and returns both paths in the V3 full or trace report.

`--full-health` changes the caller's case into an undeclared counterfactual
root. Its replay-verified actions may still be exported for diagnosis, but no
manifest is written and the original case is not claimed as their root. Export
the counterfactual root as its own case before it can become typed evidence.

The local graph starts with `--max-potions-used 0` and omits explicit potion
discard. Pass a positive potion budget only for an explicit potion lane. Add
`--include-discard-actions` only for an all-legal slot-generation or
revive-priority diagnostic; either change can materially alter a sparse search
corridor.

Deepest-survival and deepest-progress exports remain descendant cases with
prefix actions. They are not complete witnesses from those adjacent cases and
do not use this manifest contract.

## Historical Combat Witness Exports

`export-historical-combat-witness` replays the journal to the selected combat
root and writes a producer manifest beside the exported actions. This gives a
later evidence audit exact case/action identity without filename inference.
Its command report also carries the source line identity and the selected
combat-root identity. Node ids remain workspace-local and must not be used to
join reports from different workspace files.

Before using an independently saved case beside a run witness, run
`diagnose-run-witness --case <case.json>`. The origin check requires the case's
typed production context and matches both its exact combat-state hash and its
run-session fingerprint against one replayed journal entry. A state-only or
derived case is deliberately rejected rather than attributed by seed/floor.

A local-graph `*.prefix.actions.json` beside a descendant case describes the
path from the original root to that descendant. It must not be paired with the
descendant case as though it started there. Such artifacts remain legacy
evidence until their producer carries the original-case identity.

## Combat Laboratory V1

The Combat Laboratory is an offline mode of `combat_search_v2_driver`. Run the
maintained seed006-derived Reptomancer pilot with:

```powershell
cargo run -p sts_oracle_tools --bin combat_search_v2_driver -- --lab-spec fixtures/combat_lab/seed006_reptomancer_8x2.lab.json --lab-output artifacts/runs/combat-lab-seed006-pilot --lab-samples 8
```

Rerun the same command and output directory to resume journaled cells. Increase
only `--lab-samples` to extend the deterministic schedule. Resume rejects
changes to the scenario, schedule, profiles, budget, schema, or source
identity.

Each laboratory directory contains:

- `manifest.json`: immutable resolved experiment and provenance;
- `cells.jsonl`: append-only raw evidence and evidence authority;
- `checkpoint.json`: rebuildable resume accelerator;
- `summary.json`: reproducible aggregate.

Exact-replayed wins and losses are distinct from coverage limits and
infrastructure errors. Read outcome rates with their coverage denominators.
The pilot is explicitly seed006-derived and exact-state-oracle: it does not
restore consumed campaign RNG or model a human-visible-information policy.

## Campfire Threat Panel V1

The offline Campfire panel compares every alignable exact candidate against a
declared public encounter pool with matched analysis RNG and shuffle samples.
It never reads the live hidden encounter queue or changes Campfire policy.

```powershell
cargo run -p sts_oracle_tools --release --bin combat_search_v2_driver -- --threat-panel-spec fixtures/campfire_threat_panel/seed006_pre_transient_reconstructed.panel.json --threat-panel-output artifacts/runs/campfire-threat-panel-seed006-pilot --threat-panel-samples 1
```

The fixture is reconstructed from recorded public deck and resource state. It
does not claim the original hidden RNG or route map. Repeating the same command
resumes completed cells; increasing only the sample target extends the fixed
shuffle schedule.

Read the two lenses separately:

- `actual_consequence` retains each candidate's real post-Campfire resources;
- `root_hp_capability` resets only current HP to isolate equal-starting-HP
  mechanical capability.

Direction reversals are encounter-specific evidence, not a global Campfire
score. Coverage-limited rows may contain replayed candidates but do not prove
search optimality. Historical artifacts remain readable; rerunning a removed
profile requires the Git commit recorded in its manifest.
