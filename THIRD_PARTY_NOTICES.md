## Stable-Baselines3

`learning/src/sts_learning/run_rollout.py` adapts the reverse generalized
advantage-estimation and lambda-return recurrence from Stable-Baselines3
v2.9.0, commit `8908708f10c8ff29759c67f55c8acb56cab27463`, file
`stable_baselines3/common/buffers.py`. The local implementation is rewritten
around complete typed attempts, ragged candidates, undiscounted action time,
terminal-only episodes, and equal per-attempt weighting.
